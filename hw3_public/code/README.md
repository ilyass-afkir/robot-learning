# Robot Learning Exercise
-------------------------
**Prepare the environment**
  1. If conda is not yet installed on your PC, you can check here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
  2. Install the conda environment:
    ```
    make install
    ```
  3. Activate the conda environment:
    ```
    conda activate robot-learning-ex3
    ```
  4. For Problem 3.1 c, d, e, f run:
    ```
    python code/ml.py
    ```
  5. Run Linear Regression task [Problem 3.2]:
    ```
    python code/linear_regression.py
    ```
  6. Run K-Means Clustering task [Problem 3.3]:
    ```
    python code/k_means.py
    ```

**You can also use "pip" to install the requirements**

**How to use the exercise latex template:**
  1. You find the template as *.zip file in the homework directory (keep it as zip):
    ```
    ../hw3_public/exercise_template.zip
    ```
  2. Open your overleaf:
    ```
    https://sharelatex01.ca.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de/project
    ```
  3. Choose the template:
    ```
    new project >  upload project > select a zip file 
    ```
  4. Now you are able to compile it directly

**Additional Information:**
  * You should place your code in the parts where it says "TODO".
  * Attach your plots to the PDF file and submit your code as a python file for every task beside the PDF file.
